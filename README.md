## Description
### Challenge 1
This JavaScript function takes a string input and swaps the case of each character. It iterates through the string, converting uppercase characters to lowercase and lowercase characters to uppercase, resulting in a string where the case of each character is reversed.
### Challenge 2
This JavaScript function generates an array of integers between two given numbers, inclusively. It dynamically creates the array based on the input, ensuring inclusion of all integers within the specified range, whether positive or negative.
### Challenge 3
This task involves creating a function that filters an array of numbers to extract prime numbers while maintaining their original order. It requires an efficient algorithm to accurately identify prime numbers, ensuring the resulting array contains only primes in the same order as the input array.
